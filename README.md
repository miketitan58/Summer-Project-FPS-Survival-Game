# Summer Project 2022

## Survival FPS Game
This game is designed to be a light fps combat
survival style game in a post-apocalyptic arena

There will be multiple enemy types with different 
strengths and weaknesses. Along with that, there
will be multiple weapon types with their own
advantages and disadvantgates for players to 
choose from.

## Current State
As I am working full time, and doing a lot of 
addition learning on the side, the game production
is very slow. Right now the game is currently in the 
development phase, and has very little game functionality 
as of yet. The level design however is almost complete.

## Coming Soon
- Fully integrated shooting mechanics
- Several enemy types with different animations
- powerups (health, speed, etc.)
- Completed, well-designed map
- Full Original Soundtrack
