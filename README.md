# Summer Project 2022

## Survival FPS Game
This game is designed to be a light fps combat
survival style game in a post-apocalyptic arena

## Current State
As I am working full time, and doing a lot of 
addition learning on the side, the game production
is very slow. Right now the game is currently in the 
level-design phase, and has no game functionality 
as of yet.

## Coming Soon
- Fully integrated shooting mechanics
- Several enemy types with different animations
- powerups (health, speed, etc.)
- Completed, well-designed map
